## 🔄 How to Use Multi-Semester Feature

### **Step 1: Select Semester**
```
Click dropdown → Select desired semester (1/3/5/7)
```

### **Step 2: Load Sample Data (Optional)**
```
Click "Load Sample Data" → Confirm → Data populated
```

### **Step 3: Customize Data**
```
Add/remove classes, subjects, teachers as needed
Modify periods, types, classroom assignments
```

### **Step 4: Add Data for Other Semesters**
```
Switch to different semester
Add classes, subjects, teachers
Repeat for all active semesters
```

### **Step 5: Generate Timetable**
```
Select the semester you want to generate
Click "Generate Timetable"
System automatically checks ALL semesters for teacher conflicts
```

## ⚠️ Teacher Collision Detection

### **How It Works:**
1. System collects data from ALL semesters with active classes
2. When generating for Semester 3, checks if teachers are busy in Semesters 1, 5, 7
3. Automatically avoids scheduling conflicts

### **Example Scenario:**
```
Semester 1: Prof. Sharma teaches Math at Monday P1
Semester 3: System will NOT schedule Prof. Sharma at Monday P1

This ensures Prof. Sharma can teach both semesters without conflict
```

### **Shared Teachers:**
Many teachers teach across semesters:
- Foundation faculty (Sem 1) may teach core courses (Sem 3)
- Specialized faculty (Sem 5, 7) may share elective courses
- Lab instructors may handle multiple semester labs

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **1. Plan Shared Resources First**
```
Identify teachers who teach multiple semesters
Add their subjects in all relevant semesters
Generate in order: 1 → 3 → 5 → 7
```

### **2. Designate Specific Lab Rooms**
```
Semester 1: Physics Lab, Chemistry Lab, C Lab
Semester 3: KOTAK1, KOTAK2, CBL1
Semester 5: Database Lab, AIML Lab, TOC Lab
Semester 7: ML Lab, IoT Lab, Project Lab
```

### **3. Common Classes Coordination**
```
Avoid scheduling common classes at same time across semesters
Example: Don't have Sem 1 Orientation AND Sem 7 Industry Talk both at Mon P1
This frees up faculty and resources
```

### **4. Friday Half-Day Consistency**
```
All semesters: Friday only has P1-P4
Plan lighter load on Fridays
Good for: Common activities, seminars, guest lectures
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

✨ **Consistent Teacher Names:** Use exact same name across semesters for collision detection
✨ **Lab Room Strategy:** Create specific lab rooms for each major lab subject
✨ **Common Activities:** Schedule at different times across semesters to avoid resource conflicts
✨ **Data Persistence:** Your data is saved automatically when switching semesters
✨ **Generation Order:** Generate lower semesters first, then higher ones
✨ **Teacher Availability:** Some teachers exclusively for one semester, others shared

## 🎓 Curriculum Progression

**Semester 1:** Foundation → Basic Sciences + Intro Programming
**Semester 3:** Core CS → DS, OS, Digital Logic
**Semester 5:** Advanced → Networks, DB, Web, AI
**Semester 7:** Specialization → ML, Cloud, IoT, Projects

Each semester builds on the previous, with increasing specialization and project work!
